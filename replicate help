**Replicate Help**

*The replicate alias is here to help you manage replications for your artificer. It will keep track of your replications and for any replication which grants additional abilities will add a suitable actions to your character for that ability.*

__Replicate help and guidance__

`!replicate help` - show this help page
`!replicate` -  list your current replications and replication counter values
`!replicate list [search]` - list all supported replications available at your Artificer level, if search text is entered only those matching the text will be listed.

__Creating an infusion__

`!replicate <name> add  [armor]` - will replicate an item of the named type and add it to your character

Artificer armorer with the Armor Modifications feature may use the `armor` option. This will cause the replication to be created using the additional infusion slot granted by Armor Replication.

__Deleting a replication__

`!replicate <name> del` - will remove a replication of the named type from your character

*If the replication was created using Armor Replication the alias will remove it appropriately*

__Generic Items__

At levels 2, 10 and 14 an artificer can replicate items not specifically listed at rarities of common, uncommon and rare respectively. To create a generic item

`!replicate <rarity> <name>`

To delete a generic item and free up the slot use

`!replicate <rarity> <name> del`

__Magic Item Tinker__

The abilities in Magic Item Tinker (6th level Artificer) have been integrated with replicate

`!replicate charge <name> -l <level>` Will use a spell slot to replace depleted charges in the named replication

`!replicate drain <name>` will remove the named replication and create an additional spell slot of the appropriate level and maintain the counter of times you may do this

`!replicate transmute <name> <name>` will replace the first named replication with a new replication type named in the second argument and maintain the counter of times you may do this

The drain feature can create slots in excess of the normal maximum. The alias creates a new cc which is compatible with the one created by my existing !font and !scast aliases. Casting with !scast will seamlessly use excess slots from drain when no other slots remain. These aliases can be found at https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/63642cf19c51e9ffa9ce9d8b


__Loaned replications__

Replicated items can be loaned to other characters by an artificer. When using this alias to receive a loaned replication you must specify the level of artificer who replicated the item. A loan item will work exactly like any other replicated item but will not require or use replication slots on the character holding it.

`!replicate <name> add  -l <artificer level>` - this will be marked in the character infusions list as a loan

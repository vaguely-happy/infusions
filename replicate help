**Replicate Help**

*The replicate alias is here to help you manage replications for your artificer. It will keep track of your replications and for any replication which grants additional abilities will add a suitable actions to your character for that ability.*

__Replicate help and guidance__

`!replicate help` - show this help page
`!replicate` -  list your current replications and replication counter values
`!replicate list [search]` - list all supported replications available at your Artificer level, if search text is entered only those matching the text will be listed.

__Creating an infusion__

`!replicate <name> add  [armor]` - will replicate an item of the named type and add it to your character

Artificer armorer with the Armor Modifications feature may use the `armor` option. This will cause the replication to be created using the additional infusion slot granted by Armor Replication.

__Deleting a replication__

`!replicate <name> del` - will remove a replication of the named type from your character

*If the replication was created using Armor Replication the alias will remove it appropriately*

__Generic Items__

At levels 2, 10 and 14 an artificer can replicate items not specifically listed at rarities of common, uncommon and rare respectively. To create a generic item

`!replicate <rarity> <name>`

To delete a generic item and free up the slot use

`!replicate <rarity> <name> del`


__Loaned replications__

Replicated items can be loaned to other characters by an artificer. When using this alias to receive a loaned replication you must specify the level of artificer who replicated the item. A loan item will work exactly like any other replicated item but will not require or use replication slots on the character holding it.

`!replicate <name> add  -l <artificer level>` - this will be marked in the character infusions list as a loan

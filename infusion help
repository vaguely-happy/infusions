**Infusion Help**

*The infusion alias is here to help you manage infusions for your artificer. It will keep track of your infusions and for any infusion which grants additional abilities will add a suitable actions to your character for that ability.*

__Infusion help and guidance__

`!infusion help` - show this help page
`!infusion` -  list your current infusions and infusion counter values
`!infusion list [search]` - list all supported infusions available at your Artificer level, if search text is entered only those matching the text will be listed.

__Creating an infusion__

`!infusion add <name> [armor]` - will infuse an item of the named type and add it to your character

Artificer armorer with the Armor Modifications feature may use the `armor` option. This will cause the infusion to be created using the additional infusion slots granted by Armor Modifications

__Deleting an infusion__

`!infusion del <name>` - will remove an infusion of the named type from your character

*If the infusion was created using Armor Modifications the alias will remove it appropriately*

__Loaned infusions__

Infusions can be loaned to other characters by an artificer. When using this alias to receive a loaned infusion you must specify the level of artificer who infused the item. A loan item will work exactly like any other infusion but will not require or use infusion slots on the character holding it.

`!infusion add <name> -l <artificer level>` - this will be marked in the character infusions list as a loan

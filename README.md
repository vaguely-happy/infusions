# infusions
An alias to manage artificer infusions on your characters. It will keep track of infusions made and will add counters and actions for the infusions.

Also supports lending of infusions to non-artificers who will gain the same counters and actions.

See `!infusion help` for details of how to use

The main parts of the code are in infusions (the alias) and infusionlib (held as a gvar lib)

The data is all held in infusiondefs which is deployed as a gvar. This is written and maintained in infusions.xlsx which is where the individual actions are stored in a more accessible form.
